# Core Protocol Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the components and architecture necessary for the Core Protocol of the DataHive ecosystem. The Core Protocol serves as the foundation for data operations, security mechanisms, and interoperability with various nodes and services within DataHive. It is essential for establishing secure, efficient, and transparent interactions across the network.

### Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to define, develop, and maintain the core functionalities that power the DataHive ecosystem. This includes implementing [APIs](./docs/API-Gateway.md), [data handling protocols](./docs/Data-Handling-Protocols.md), and [security features](./docs/Security-Features.md) to safeguard user data and ensure compliance with global regulations.

### Key Features
- **[API Gateway](./docs/API-Gateway.md)**: Centralized API management for interacting with nodes.
- **[Data Handling Protocols](./docs/Data-Handling-Protocols.md)**: Mechanisms to ensure secure and efficient data transactions.
- **[Security Features](./docs/Security-Features.md)**: Encryption and authentication protocols to protect user data.
- **[Interoperability](./docs/Interoperability.md)**: Facilitating communication between different types of nodes (e.g., Legalese Nodes, Consent Nodes).

### Folder Structure
- `docs/`: Documentation related to core protocol architecture, APIs, and security protocols.
- `src/`: Source code for core protocol components.
- `tests/`: Unit tests and integration tests for core protocol functionality.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for deployment, testing, or other tasks.
