# Core Protocol Repository

This repository contains the components and architecture necessary for the **Core Protocol** of the DataHive ecosystem. The Core Protocol serves as the foundation for data operations, security mechanisms, and interoperability with various nodes and services within DataHive. It is essential for establishing secure, efficient, and transparent interactions across the network.

### Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to define, develop, and maintain the core functionalities that power the DataHive ecosystem. This includes implementing [APIs](./docs/API-Gateway.md), [data handling protocols](./docs/Data-Handling-Protocols.md), and [security features](./docs/Security-Features.md) to safeguard user data and ensure compliance with global regulations.

### Key Features
- **[API Gateway](./docs/API-Gateway.md)**: Centralized API management for interacting with nodes.
- **[Data Handling Protocols](./docs/Data-Handling-Protocols.md)**: Mechanisms to ensure secure and efficient data transactions between nodes and external applications.
- **[Security Features](./docs/Security-Features.md)**: Encryption, authentication, and compliance protocols to protect user data.
- **[Interoperability](./docs/Interoperability.md)**: Facilitating communication between different types of nodes (e.g., Legalese Nodes, Consent Nodes).

### Folder Structure
This repository is organized into the following structure:

- `docs/`: Documentation related to core protocol architecture, APIs, security protocols, and other essential components.
  - Example files:
    - `API-Gateway.md`: Documentation on how external applications interact with nodes via APIs.
    - `Data-Handling-Protocols.md`: Detailed explanation of how data is processed securely within the protocol.
    - `Security-Features.md`: Information on encryption protocols, authentication mechanisms, and compliance standards.
    - `Interoperability.md`: Details on how various nodes communicate within the DataHive ecosystem.
  
- `src/`: Source code for core protocol components such as API gateways, consensus mechanisms, and node interaction logic.

- `tests/`: Unit tests and integration tests for validating core protocol functionality.

- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for deployment, testing automation, or other tasks related to maintaining the core protocol.

### How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from students, contractors, node launchpads, NaaS (Node-as-a-Service) providers, and internal development teams! However, since this project is still in its early stages, we are managing contributions carefully to ensure that development aligns with our roadmap and goals.

#### Steps to Contribute:
1. **Express Interest**: If you're interested in contributing or partnering (e.g., as a contractor or NaaS provider), please reach out via email at [team@datahive.network](mailto:team@datahive.network) or join our community on [Telegram](https://t.me/datahiveofficial).
2. **Get Assigned Tasks**: Once you've expressed interest, we will assign tasks or issues for you to work on based on your expertise.
3. **Collaborate**: Collaborate with our internal team or other contributors through GitHub issues and pull requests.
4. **Submit Pull Requests**: Once a task is completed, submit a pull request for review by our core team.
