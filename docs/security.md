# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security requirements and guidelines for DataHive's Core Protocol smart contract interactions and token handling mechanisms.

## Overview

Security is fundamental to the DataHive protocol infrastructure. These guidelines ensure the safety and integrity of protocol operations, smart contract interactions, and token handling across the entire ecosystem.

## Smart Contract Security

### Token Economics Security
```solidity
// Protocol-Level Security Requirements
stake():
  - Input validation
  - Balance verification
  - Reentrancy guard implementation
  - Event emission verification
  - Gas limit enforcement: <= 120,000 gas

unstake():
  - Lockup period validation
  - Balance verification
  - Reentrancy protection
  - Event emission checks
  - Gas limit enforcement: <= 100,000 gas

claimRewards():
  - Reward calculation verification
  - Double-claim prevention
  - State update validation
  - Event emission checks
  - Gas limit enforcement: <= 150,000 gas
```

### Protocol Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-signature governance
- Time-lock mechanisms
- Emergency pause functionality
- Upgrade mechanisms

## Token Security

### Supported Assets (Testnet1)
```solidity
// Protocol-Wide Token Requirements
ETH:
  - Native L2 transaction validation
  - Gas limit monitoring
  - Value overflow protection

USDC, USDT:
  - ERC20 compliance verification
  - Allowance validation
  - Balance checks
  - Decimal handling

BTC (Wrapped):
  - Wrapper contract validation
  - Custody verification
  - Bridge security checks
```

## Protocol Security

### Transaction Validation
- Input sanitization
- Parameter bounds checking
- Gas optimization
- State consistency verification

### State Management
- Atomic operations
- State transition validation
- Consistent state updates
- Recovery mechanisms

## Cross-Chain Security

### Bridge Operations
- Message verification
- State synchronization
- Rollback procedures
- Timeout handling

### Asset Transfer Security
- Bridge limit enforcement
- Cross-chain verification
- Asset lockup validation
- Reconciliation checks

## Monitoring Requirements

### Security Monitoring
```yaml
Real-time Monitoring:
  - Transaction patterns
  - Gas usage anomalies
  - Error frequencies
  - State inconsistencies
  - Bridge operations
```

### Alert System
- Threshold violations
- Suspicious patterns
- System anomalies
- Bridge issues

## Audit Requirements

### Smart Contract Audits
- Static analysis
- Dynamic testing
- Formal verification
- Manual review
- Gas optimization

### Security Testing
- Penetration testing
- Fuzzing operations
- Stress testing
- Vulnerability scanning

## Emergency Procedures

### Circuit Breakers
```solidity
// Protocol-Wide Emergency Controls
- Asset transfer suspension
- Bridge operation pause
- Protocol upgrade freeze
- Emergency shutdown
```

### Recovery Procedures
- State recovery
- Asset recovery
- Bridge recovery
- System restoration

## Security Best Practices

### Development Guidelines
1. Latest compiler versions
2. Checked arithmetic
3. Gas optimization
4. Event logging
5. Access control

### Deployment Security
1. Multi-sig deployment
2. Phased rollout
3. Monitoring setup
4. Backup procedures
