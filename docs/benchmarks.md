This document outlines the performance benchmarking requirements and standards for LN1 node-level operations and smart contract interactions on OP Sepolia testnet.

## Overview

Performance benchmarking ensures that smart contracts and node operations meet efficiency standards while maintaining security and reliability on Layer 2. These benchmarks serve as acceptance criteria for deployment approval on OP Sepolia testnet1.

## Staking Requirements

### Accepted Tokens
```solidity
// Testnet1 Accepted Tokens
ETH  // Native L2 token
USDC // Test USDC on OP Sepolia
USDT // Test USDT on OP Sepolia
BTC  // Wrapped BTC on OP Sepolia
```

## Gas Optimization Benchmarks

### Token Economics Contract
```solidity
// OP Sepolia Gas Limits
stake(): <= 40,000 gas
unstake(): <= 35,000 gas
claimRewards(): <= 50,000 gas
```

### Node Registration Contract
```solidity
// Target gas consumption limits
registerNode(): <= 50,000 gas
updateNodeStatus(): <= 20,000 gas
removeNode(): <= 35,000 gas
```

### Data Validation Contract
```solidity
validateLegalData(): <= 75,000 gas
updateValidationRules(): <= 30,000 gas
processDataBatch(): <= 200,000 gas
```

## Transaction Throughput

### Single Node Operations
- Node Registration: >= 500 TPS (L2 optimized)
- Data Validation: >= 200 TPS
- Token Operations: >= 1000 TPS

### Network-Wide Operations
- Cross-Node Communication: <= 500ms latency
- Consensus Achievement: <= 2s for 67% nodes
- State Synchronization: <= 1s propagation time

## Memory Usage

### Smart Contract Deployment
- Contract Size: <= 24KB per contract
- Constructor Execution: <= 3M gas (L2 optimized)
- Initialization Cost: <= 2M gas

### Runtime Performance
- Storage Slots Used: <= 500 per operation
- Memory Peak: <= 64KB per transaction
- Stack Depth: <= 1024 levels

## Testing Environment

### Local Testing
```yaml
Hardware Requirements:
  CPU: >= 4 cores
  RAM: >= 16GB
  Storage: >= 100GB SSD
```

### OP Sepolia Requirements
```yaml
Network Conditions:
  Latency: <= 50ms
  Bandwidth: >= 10Mbps
  Node Count: >= 5 nodes
```

## Benchmark Tools

### Gas Profiling
```bash
# Run gas profiling for L2
npm run benchmark:gas:l2

# Generate L2-specific report
npm run benchmark:report:l2
```

### Load Testing
```bash
# Execute L2 load tests
npm run benchmark:load:l2

# Generate L2 performance report
npm run benchmark:performance:l2
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Requirements
- All L2 gas limits consistently met
- Transaction throughput meets L2 TPS requirements
- Memory usage within L2 bounds
- Network latency under L2 thresholds

### Testing Coverage
- 100% of contract functions tested on OP Sepolia
- All token interactions verified
- Performance consistent over 10,000+ transactions
- Cross-chain operations verified with all accepted tokens

## Reporting

### Benchmark Results Format
```json
{
  "contractName": "NodeRegistration",
  "function": "registerNode",
  "gasUsed": 45000,
  "executionTime": "0.3s",
  "memoryPeak": "32KB",
  "network": "op-sepolia",
  "status": "PASS"
}
```

### Continuous Monitoring
- Hourly performance snapshots
- Daily trend analysis
- Weekly optimization reviews
- Monthly audit reports

## Integration Points

### Core Protocol Interaction
- API response time <= 200ms
- Webhook processing <= 500ms
- Event propagation <= 1s

### Cross-Chain Operations
- Bridge transaction time <= 3s
- State verification <= 2s
- Rollback execution <= 2s

## Optimization Guidelines

1. Optimize for L2 specific operations
2. Minimize cross-chain calls
3. Batch operations when possible
4. Implement efficient token handling
5. Optimize for accepted token interactions
